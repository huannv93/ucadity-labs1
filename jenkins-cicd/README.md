## Pipeline Description

The Jenkins pipeline is configured to perform the following tasks:

1. **Build, Test, and Deploy to AWS ECS Cluster:**
   - The pipeline includes stages for building, testing, and deploying applications to an AWS ECS cluster.
   - The configuration is defined in the Jenkinsfile in your source code repository.

2. **Receive Pipeline Notifications on Slack:**
   - Slack integration is set up to receive notifications about pipeline build status.
   - Configure Slack notifications as per the guide provided [here](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/see-build-status-in-slack-with-jenkins-slack-integration).

Feel free to customize the pipeline according to your specific application and deployment requirements.
